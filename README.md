### DevCamper API Overview

The DevCamper API is a robust backend service designed to manage a platform for coding bootcamps, courses, and user interactions. This API is built using Node.js and Express, leveraging MongoDB for data storage, providing a highly efficient and scalable solution for educational institutions and learners alike.

#### Features

1. **Bootcamp Management**

   - **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete bootcamps.
   - **Location-Based Searches**: Find bootcamps within a specific radius.
   - **Advanced Filtering and Pagination**: Sort and filter bootcamps based on various criteria such as location, price, average rating, etc.

2. **Course Management**

   - **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete courses associated with specific bootcamps.
   - **Course Filtering**: Filter courses by bootcamp, cost, duration, and more.
   - **Enrollment Management**: Manage students enrolled in various courses.

3. **User Management and Authentication**

   - **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
   - **User Roles**: Differentiate access and permissions based on user roles (e.g., admin, publisher, user).
   - **Account Management**: Handle user registration, login, and profile updates.
   - **Password Recovery**: Implement secure password recovery mechanisms.

4. **Security and User Sessions**
   - **JWT and Cookies**: Use JWT for stateless authentication and store tokens securely in HTTP-only cookies to maintain user sessions.
   - **Role-Based Access Control**: Restrict access to certain API endpoints based on user roles.
   - **Data Validation and Sanitization**: Ensure that data received from users is properly validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.

#### Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Provides a scalable and efficient runtime environment for the API.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that allows for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to manage data relationships, schema validation, and more.

#### Key Functionalities

1. **Bootcamp API**

   - Endpoints to create, read, update, and delete bootcamps.
   - Implementing geospatial queries to find bootcamps within a certain distance.
   - Advanced query features for sorting, filtering, and pagination.

2. **Course API**

   - Endpoints to manage courses tied to specific bootcamps.
   - Features to enroll users in courses and manage course-related data.
   - Filtering and searching capabilities to help users find relevant courses.

3. **User API**
   - User authentication and authorization using JWT.
   - Role management to ensure proper access control.
   - Secure endpoints for user registration, login, profile updates, and password management.

#### Authentication and Security

- **JWT Tokens**: Securely sign tokens to authenticate users without maintaining session state on the server.
- **Cookies**: Store JWT tokens in HTTP-only cookies to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources.
- **Data Validation**: Validate incoming data to protect against injection attacks and other common security threats.

### Conclusion

The DevCamper API is a comprehensive and secure backend service for managing bootcamps, courses, and user authentication. Its use of modern technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB ensures high performance and scalability. With robust security features, including JWT authentication and role-based access control, the DevCamper API is well-suited for building and maintaining a reliable educational platform.
